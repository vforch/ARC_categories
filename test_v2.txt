https://arcprize.org/play?task=1ae2feb7  |  hard  |  string parsing  |  strings, occlusion, order, spatial frequency, relative orientation, empty/full  |  ambiguity-inconsequential (Is the order of symbols within strings allocentric?)  |  space size; side size; string length; pattern length; orientation; color of divide line  |  symbols in strings define color and frequency of patterns; patterns are stacked by order of generation; empty symbol is ignored  |  weak systematicity of symbols; no semantic constraints  |  length of string; length of pattern; number of strings and patterns  |  copy; mono line (divide line) divides space into 2 sides; non-empty side contains symbol strings; symbol strings are lines orthogonal to divide line, spanning empty side, containing mono lines of len N representing symbols and empty; strings are read left to right, each symbol is associated with a 1D pattern paramterized by color of symbol and N; patterns are constructed from single squares of same color as symbol repeating along 1D separated by (N - 1) empty squares growing orthogonal out of divide line into the empty side, along axis of corresponding string; later patterns override earlier ones  
https://arcprize.org/play?task=3e6067c3  |  easy  |  string parsing  |  strings, shapes, spatial connectedness, size, relative orientation  |  ...  |  bg color; border color; square translation  |  strings define order in which the squares with different fill colors are connected; connection needs to be a vertical or horizontal line with width equal to fill side length; color of connection is determined by color of previous square fill  |  weak systematicity of colors  |  number of squares; length of connections; size of squares; size of border  |  copy; there's a bg color; a string made up of singular colored squares seperated by bg squares is depicted in the bottom of the space; the rest of the space is filled with squares with uniform border colors and different fills; border thickness and fill square size are each homogeneous for a sample; the string determines the order in which squares have to be connected with vertical or horizontal lines; lines have thickness equal to the side length of fill squares; connection lines connect fill squares without penetrating the border
